title: Endure - A Proceduraly-Generated, 2D, Exploration Game
---

Mystery, discovery, confusion, panic, fear, curiosity. The feeling of adventure that you get from the original Zelda is pretty hard to beat. Everything after the start of the game is completely up to you and there's barely any hand holding. If you haven't built up the right amount of game intuition, you might not even head into the first cave and get a sword. Finding anything in Zelda is an accomplishment, even the very first dungeon.

When you play Zelda, you know you are on an adventure, without needing an intro cutscene or npc to tell you so. The adventure is real because you are actually living it. The choices and consequences are yours.

Perhaps one of the worst parts of Zelda, is that the adventure  eventually ends. When you play the game a second time every item, cave and old man are in the exact same places. Wouldn't it be amazing if every time you played you could create a new story and find a whole new world. A team of fellow developers and I pursed this vision and created Endure, a procedurally generated Zelda game. Every time you play the game, start with a different tool and an entire new world to uncover.
