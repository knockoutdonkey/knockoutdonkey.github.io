### Games and Me

Game design and programming are my two great passions. I love using clever algorithms to deliver deep, but intuitive gameplay, especially regarding AI, procedural generation and user interfacing.  Unity's huge community and incredibly customizable visual editor have made it my most used game engine, but I've also built up strong skills with plenty of others, like Phaser.io and Love2D.
